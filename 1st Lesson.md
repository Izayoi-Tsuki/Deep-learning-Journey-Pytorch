Let us start with a very important pain in the ass---Environment!
Actually I believe most of you on Github would not need this tutorial.
Yet most honest I shall be to record the difficulties I have encountered.
So...I shall give my method to solve the "Environment" problem. It may not be the best, but not hard to do it on your own PC.

Introducing the mighty 

Anaconda!

I recommend you to download Anaconda from its website (https://www.anaconda.com/download).

-
and scroll all the way down until you see "Download Miniconda Installer", Click the button!

and I think you can choose miniconda since all we need here is Python, Conda and essential dependencies just like it said!
But if you do want to have its full service, and I think the full conda package is also cool. the problem is that it is a larger file.
But it would not harm.

-
then you have the installer of conda, the answer.
just let it cook
