Let us start with a very important pain in the ass---Environment!
Actually I believe most of you on Github would not need this tutorial.
Yet most honest I shall be to record the difficulties I have encountered.
So...I shall give my method to solve the "Environment" problem. It may not be the best, but not hard to do it on your own PC.

First, it's Nerdy Hour! 🤓

What is an "environment"? In my understanding, it is better to be refered as a "Workshop" where specific tools (like Python and PyTorch) are organized and ready.

The challenge is that your original system (the "default room") doesn't come with the specialized tools we need. To build something(or at least to use Pytorch), we must construct a new workshop from scratch, bringing every essential instrument directly to our hands.

Introducing the mighty 

Anaconda!

I recommend you to download Anaconda from its website (https://www.anaconda.com/download).

-
and scroll all the way down until you see "Download Miniconda Installer", Click the button!

and I think you can choose miniconda since all we need here is Python, Conda and essential dependencies just like it said!
But if you do want to have its full service, I think the full conda package is also cool. the problem is that it is a larger file.
But it would not harm.

then you have the installer of conda, the answer.
just let it cook

Yet you may encounter these choices. I recommend you to choose like I chose. Since we could minimalize the change conda would make to your PC.

-
Now we need to do some actual coding. Yet it would not be difficult. And understand them would provide you a shallow yet necessary view about environment.

First I want you to find "Anaconda Prompt" and run it. You can find it in the Window Menu or search it by name.
