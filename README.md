# Deep-learning-Journey-Pytorch

Status Quo:
I am a 25-year-old post-graduate student majoring in Philosophy and about to graduate. I think I need some practical thinking so I start to learn basic Python and Pytorch.
I have learned Python by following MIT classes online. And I do write scripts in Godot (a game engine) whose coding language is much alike with Python. And I have learned Numpy,Pandas through Kaggle and 'Python Data Science Handbook', but I have not done a good job and cannot recall most of what I have learned.

Reason I do this:
It would be interesting and shocking for a guy who never thought he would dive into coding and machine learning before. I am a slow learner as well, so I would like to share what I learn from the tutorials of Pytorch (https://docs.pytorch.ac.cn/tutorials/beginner/) which would keep me doing this campaign.
For me, I think this would also be a chance to establish some evidence that I am trying to learn something out of my realm. And I really want to use my knowledge, so this would be a good start.

Difficulties and Ambition:
And it would also be a very difficult path since I have no much coding skill before and I have problem of focusing on things for a long time. And English is not my mother tongue, it would be difficult for me and you to understand what I see and write.
Yet one who strives for conquering must first conquer himself. And if Zarathustra did not go up to the top, how could he later came down from the mountain?

Hope:
So let's do this. I am not a very classical liberal arts guy. I know a lot (I hope so) about natural science and try my best to be enlightening. 
The only hope is that when someone sees this, he could feel a pulse of comfort since he knows there is a man starting later than him, and he can get rid of anxiety and get to work.
